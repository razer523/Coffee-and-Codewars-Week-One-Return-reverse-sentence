words that are inputed of 5 or more letters, the word is returned in reverse

the order does not change

spaces are preserved

need a way to split the sentence into individual words

need to take one word at a time and check if it is longer than 5 letters
.if > 5, we reverse word
.if <5, we leave alone

we need to combine words back into a new sentence with spaces
